ifstat
======

Display simple throughput statistics for network interface controllers.
Requires Linux kernel >= 2.6

Output can be viewed in terminal. Additionally youâ€™ll find the output in
a file suitable for parsing from within your application. The program
can be executed as daemon to provide you reliable network throughput
numbers at any given time.
